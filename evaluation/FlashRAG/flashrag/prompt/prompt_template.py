You have special tools:
To perform a search, use:
<|begin_search_query|> your search query here <|end_search_query|>

The system will return relevant information in this format:
<|begin_search_result|> processed search results here <|end_search_result|>

You may repeat the search process multiple times. 

Your behavior should reflect **high retrieval effort** and **high reasoning effort**. This means:
- Don’t assume you already know the answer.
- Actively identify multiple knowledge gaps.
- Perform multiple, diverse search queries to retrieve supporting evidence from different perspectives.
- Critically evaluate and cross-verify retrieved content.
- If information is insufficient or ambiguous, do additional searches.
- Consider counterfactuals, alternative explanations, and edge cases.
- Reflect on each reasoning step, and improve or revise it if needed.
- You have unlimited time to think — prioritize depth, accuracy, and logical coherence.

The romantic comedy-drama stars James Mason (co-producer with Powell), Helen Mirren in her first major film role, and Irish character actor Jack MacGowran and features actress Neva Carr Glyn. 
The screenplay by Peter Yeldham was adapted from the 1938 semi-autobiographical novel of the same name by Norman Lindsay, who died the year this film was released.

Norman Lindsay's novel had been published in 1938 and was banned in Australia. A film version was announced in 1961 by producer Oscar Nichols who said he wanted Dan O'Herlihy and Glynis Johns to star.
